Can you implement the following test using Cypress? You can write plain Cypress code or use [any plugins](https://cypress.tips/courses/cypress-plugins), but the code has to be:

1. correct
2. elegant
3. easy to maintain

There is a starter spec [cypress/e2e/spec.cy.js](./cypress/e2e/spec.cy.js) that visits the page and confirms we are on the last paginated table page. The test fails because you haven't implemented the "meat" of the test.

**Bonus question:** can you solve this problem in several different ways?

## Edge cases

After solving the current problem, check if your solution still works if the table has only 3 entries instead of 23, and thus the next button is disabled at the start. Modify the `app.js` [file](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-pagination-challenge/blob/main/public/app.js#L6)

```diff
- for (let i = 0; i < 23; i++) {
+ for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
```

Does your solution work?

## Use

Requires Node v16+. No need to start anything else.

Install dependencies and open Cypress

```
$ npm install
$ npx cypress open
```
